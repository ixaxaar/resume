# SOP

Functional properties of proteins are dependent upon their folding and structural motifs, peptide sequence motifs, active, binding, catalytic sites
Genes encode these properties (and give result to proteins)
Proteins interact with their environment (other proteins) and bring about change corresponding to their properties
These protein interactions form graphs
Pathways in these graphs manifest as phenotypes

What we know:
Genes exist
Regulatory factors exist that control gene expression based on environmental triggers
(Most known) Genes are subject and hence conserved through selection pressure
Compex genetic pathways, like evolution of metabolic pathways, require chromosomal level changes and assembly of (related) genes over time
